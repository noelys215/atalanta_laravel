## Architecture

The **Atalanta A.C. API** is hosted and deployed using **Laravel Forge**, which seamlessly pushes changes from GitHub to AWS upon each commit. Key components include:

1. **Laravel Framework**
    - **Routing and Controllers**: Managing API endpoints for all backend processes, including product management, user authentication, and order handling.
    - **Models and Migrations**: Powering the database layer with **MySQL** for structured data storage.

2. **AWS Integration**
    - **AWS S3**: Manages product images and other assets for efficient and scalable storage.
    - **AWS RDS**: Powers the database, hosting all essential data for products, users, and orders.

3. **Stripe API**
    - **Payments**: Handles secure transactions, ensuring smooth order processing and updating stock levels once payments are confirmed.

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
    - **Laravel Forge** deploys the API onto **AWS** with a simple "deploy on git commit" script, ensuring continuous integration with minimal manual intervention.
